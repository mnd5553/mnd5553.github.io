		<h3>About</h3>
		<p>As of now, this is a blog where thoughts and experiences are shared. This space is being created in light of where I am, and am yet to be. I hope to encourage those on the journey of embracing that tension.</p>

		<p>I've been trying to practice engagement with the word throughout my day. I'll write down a verse I might have read that morning, and keep it on me. At some point I'll reflect on it. 

		<br></br>Today, I'm reminded that He's our attonement before the LORD.</p>

		<p>I simply miss her; I want to know how she's doing, what her day was like, what's on her mind. Hear about the trouble she's having at work, but also her recognition of what the Lord wants to do in her this season. Some days I miss her more than others, and today is one of those days.

		<br></br>But in these moments, I'm obligated to remind myself why this is the better thing to do. Why keeping a healthy distance, pursuing a friendship in the future rather than now, is best. Why I need to accept that this is waht's best for me. Why the Lord's will and mine won't always be on the same page.</p>
