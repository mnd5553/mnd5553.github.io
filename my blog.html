				<h3>About Site</h3>
				<p>This is simply the introduction to what I would consider an e-journal. On the Site, I'll simply <i>post, share and record</i> all that I'm currently enjoying or working on.</p> 

				<h3>This WEEK</h3>
				<p>I'm giving this a shot. I don't know what I'm doing here, but it's currently 1:02am, Tuesday April 8th, 2025. I'm sitting here listening to <i>Solace</i> by Earl Sweatshirt. The two minute mark brings in a distorted piano on loop, as he slurs, "it's me and my nibbiling conscience". I listen and believe he can relate to those thoughts that eat away at you. Better yet, the very thoughts that reflect your inner being; providing insight to who you truly are.</p>
